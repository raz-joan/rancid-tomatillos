## Abstract
This app displays a collection of fetched movies where a user can view a specific movie.  In the detailed movie view there is the movie runtime, release date, average rating, and genre.  The movie summary and trailer are also available.  Back on the main page a user can search for a movie through its title.   
This project introduced us to the React framework along with React Router and end-to-end testing with Cypress.
