## Abstract
This app displays a collection of movies where a user can view a specific movie.  In the detailed movie view there is the movie runtime, release date, average rating, and genre.  The movie summary and trailer are also available.  Back on the main page a user can search for a movie through either the title or genre.   
This project introduced us to the React framework along with React Router and Cypress testing suite.
